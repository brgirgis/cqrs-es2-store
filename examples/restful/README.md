# cqrs-restful-demo

**A sync demo application using the [cqrs-es2](https://github.com/brgirgis/cqrs-es2) framework.**

## Requirements

- rust stable
- docker and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
  for starting database instances
- [postman](https://www.postman.com/)
  (or curl or your favorite Restful client)

Alternatively, if a standard SQL database instance is running locally
it can be utilized instead of the docker instances,
see [[the init script](../../db/postgres/init.sql) for the expected table
configuration.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/brgirgis/cqrs-es2-store

Start the docker stack and enter the project folder:

    docker-compose up -d
    cd examples/restful

Start the application

    cargo run

Call the API, the easiest way to do this is to import
the provided [postman collection](postman_collection.json)
into your Postman client.
Note that the command calls return a 204 status with no content.
For feedback on state you should call a query.
